  heroBackstory: "Genzer grew up in a corporate slum, working for scraps.\r\nWhen
    he got the chance to be in a clinical study and make some real money, he took
    it.\r\nThe participants were injected with experimental serums, and most didn\u2019t
    survive.\r\nGenzer survived, horribly mutated, but with strange new abilities
    that he would turn against The Corporations.\r\n"
