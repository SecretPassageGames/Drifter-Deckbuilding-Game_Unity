  heroBackstory: "Madrik was an aether engineer on a corporate colony, an indentured
    servant to Vektor.\nThough his life was dismal, he managed to find love, a wife.\nWhen
    she was caught stealing rations, she was executed without a moment\u2019s hesitation.\nThe
    pain was unbearable to Madrik, and he vowed to bring her back, dedicating his
    life to the study of Aethercraft."
