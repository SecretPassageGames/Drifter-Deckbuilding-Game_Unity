  heroBackstory: 'Yergov grew up in a region untouched by The Corporations, but inevitably,
    they found him.

    His parents were slaughtered while he watched from hiding.
    He alone survived, and fled his homeworld, plotting his revenge.

    For years,
    he studied the hidden powers of chemicals and elixirs, and has mastered many
    unnatural sciences.'
