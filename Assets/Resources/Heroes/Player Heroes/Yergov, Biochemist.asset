  heroBackstory: 'Yergov grew up in a region untouched by The Corporations, but inevitably,
    they found him.

    His parents were slaughtered while he watched from hiding.
    He alone survived, and fled his homeworld, plotting his revenge ever since.

    For
    years, he has studied the hidden powers of chemicals and elixirs, and has mastered
    many unnatural sciences.'
