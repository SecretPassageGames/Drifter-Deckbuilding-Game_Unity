  narrativeText:
  - "Low on fuel and all out of credits, you land in Sylus, an all-around shit place.
    But it\u2019s not corporate, so it\u2019ll do just fine."
  - You seek out the nearest speakeasy, "The Rathole," a place where dangerous people
    go to make money and kill each other.
  - You ask around at the bar, trying not to attract too much attention.
  - "The bartender hands you a card with a cold stare. \u201CWatch yourself,\u201D
    he says."
  - "You call the number on the back, and a voice speaks, \u201CThe alley on Sekherd
    and 7th. Midnight.\u201D"
  - "With no other leads and nothing to lose, you make your way into the city\u2026"
