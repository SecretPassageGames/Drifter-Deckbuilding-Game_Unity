  narrativeText:
  - The world has been burning for as long as anyone can remember...
  - 'When the fires had come and gone, the Earth was a sea of ash, and only the corporate
    mega-cities remained. '
  - Before the death of the Earth, there was a monumental discovery...
  - 'AETHER, a powerful energy source that resides in an unseen dimension within
    our own: THE DRIFT.'
  - No one knows if it was Aether that destroyed the Earth, but it certainly facilitated
    its demise.
  - Most of the Aether that's left is controlled by The Corporations, who horde its
    power for themselves.
  - Those who work for The Corporations enjoy some measure of comfort and protection.
  - "The rest of us\u2026 are Drifters."
