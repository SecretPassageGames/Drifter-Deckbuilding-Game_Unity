  narrativeText:
  - My name is Faydra. Faydra Arrelika IV, daughter of Fentis Arrelika III.
  - My parents were corporate elites, and I grew up in the clutches of The Corporations.
  - I was 12 when I disabled the tracking unit embedded in my skull, and made my
    escape in the real world.
  - "It\u2019s not a pretty sight, but at least it\u2019s real."
  - "Only problem is, everyone wants what\u2019s inside my head. Corporate hardware,
    the best of the best."
  - Good thing it makes me so damn hard to kill.
