  narrativeText:
  - My name is Fentis. Fentis Arrelika IV, son of Fentis Arrelika III.
  - "My parents were corporate elites, and I grew up in the clutches of The Corporations\u2026"
  - I was 12 when I disabled the tracking unit embedded in my skull, and made my
    escape in the real world.
  - "It\u2019s not a pretty sight, but at least it\u2019s real."
  - "Only problem is, everyone wants what\u2019s inside my head. Corporate hardware,
    the best of the best."
  - Good thing it makes me so damn hard to kill.
