  narrativeText:
  - My name is Kili, short for Kilinthia. Never had a last name.
  - "I was an orphan, like so many others\u2026"
  - Marched into a corporate education facility, I was put to work from a young age.
    Just more fuel for the machine.
  - I made my escape at the age of 9, into the streets of The Undercity.
  - I quickly found myself in Neon Rider territory. Not a place you should be if
    you like living.
  - 'They gave me a choice: ride, or die.'
  - That was 10 years ago.
  - Now I ride as one of them, and we give The Corporations something to fear.
