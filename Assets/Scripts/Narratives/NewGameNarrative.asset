    But it\u2019s not corporate, so it\u2019ll do just fine."
  - I seek out the nearest rathole, a place where dangerous people go to make money
    and kill each other.
  - I ask around at the bar, trying not to attract too much attention.
  - "The bartender hands me a card with a cold stare. \u201CWatch yourself,\u201D
    he says."
  - "I call the number on the back, and a voice speaks, \u201CThe alley on Sekherd
