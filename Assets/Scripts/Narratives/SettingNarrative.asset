  narrativeText:
  - The world has been burning for as long as anyone can remember...
  - 'When the fires had come and gone, the earth was a sea of ash, and only the corporate
    mega-cities remained. '
  - Before the planet's demise, there was a monumental discovery...
  - 'Aether, a powerful energy source that resides in an unseen dimension within
    our own: The Drift.'
  - No one knows if aether destroyed the earth, but it certainly facilitated its
    destruction.
  - Most of the aether that's left is controlled by Th</i>e Corp</i>orat</i>ions,
    who horde its power for themselves.
  - Those who work for Th</i>e Corp</i>orat</i>ions enjoy some measure of comfort
    and protection.
  - "The rest of us\u2026 are Drifters."
